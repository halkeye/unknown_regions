Old forest Hermit~
Old forest Hermit
~
The Hermit is a short old man with a knowledge that sparkles in his eyes. He
has seen much and been almost everywhere, now he just wanders about and 
collects artifacts from ages long lost and forgotten. His most recent
aquisition: A very old and dangerous artifact from the great war that ravaged
these lands, it appears to still be intact but it will take much to make this
hermit part with it.

&B&bI&rtzana &bK&rintouni&G
~
Itzana is a wonderfully curvascious twi'lek thats edging on the tall side, she
has pale skin and rich jade green eyes which seem to call out to whom she
looks upon, he lekku are about waist length and gently sway as she walks. She
usually has a bright smile on her face and plays the part of the innocent
young female, but you wonder what might truely be behind that facade.

This is an impressive suite of Kethelin Fullplate. It is made of many small
metal plates that lock together and brace eachother, across breast plate is an
itricate engraving of the magical construction shop of Itzana, this plate
never seems to get dented or scratched.. ever. In addition to all these
wonderful features the armor seems to be magically light and cool at all

Arm~
These armguards are composed of a small tube of chainmail which leads from the
shoulder hooks down to the wrists. On the exterior of this tube are a couple
bracers around the forarms and two small shields which are attached to the
outside of the upper arm so if a weapon fails to block an attack the sholder
can be raised to deflect it instead, this looks like it was designed to
compliment the Kethelin Fullplate.

The Neck guard is built from two carefully crafted and curved metal plates.
When they lock together they hook up under the helm and down under the neck
opening of the breastplates thus providing good protecting to the neck, while
you can still turn your head fairly easily this does hamper movement a bit, it
appears to have been constructed to compliment the Kethelin Fullplate.

constrictive it actually allows quite a bit of movement, it appears to be
dessigned to compliment the Kethelin Fullplate.

shotgun~
This is an antique shotgun from an era where weapons were just bits of flying
metal, its flat black and very sturdy for the engineering methods used when it
was constructed, you see its semi-automatic mechanics have been altered
slightly and there is now a selecter to control how many shells are fired in a
rapid automatic state. Under the end of the barrel is a small stun device that
has been installed on this weapon making it quite versatile.
~
E
selecter~
The selector has 6 settings, each with the number of shells expended etched in
next to them.. Full-7 High-4 Normal-3 Half-2 Low-1 and then there is a setting
for stun which consumes 3 specially designed shells. You notice the maximum
number of shells the shotgun can hold is 14 so setting it for Full automatic
will allow you only 2 bursts.

durasteel, its only a few feet wide and about 6 feet tall. While dimly lit you
can still make your way through it without too much difficulty. From all these
detractions of comfort and astetics you take it that this passageway was
designed for minimal use and probably only by station personel.

Deffense Turet~
This small turet is one of the few minimal deffenses this asteroid spacestation
has, while it may be small the ratator cuffs give it a very smooth ride and it
can swival to point in almost any direction. While not the best of weapons it
can still probably shoot down a few starfighters or even a midship or two
before they become a real threat..

Marcie's Clothing Shop for Women~
This is Marcie's little shop. Along the walls are racks with the clothes she
makes herself, they look very well done and quite attractive. As you move to
the back of the shop the undergarments get a little more seductive. At the
very back of the shop is Marcie herself standing close to an old fashioned
cash register.

You are walking through a passageway that has been mined out of the interior of
the asteroid, this hall is lined by some heavy durasteel framing with sheets 
of it lining the exterior. Beneath your feet gravity plates line the entire

coridor is dimly lit with a single flourescent lightbar running down the

Open Field~
This large recently mowed field looks like you have steped back in time, asside
from the various ships parked here and the occasional crate this place looks
to be from an entirely different time. There is a small hardpacked dirt road
leading north and there is not one scrap of any sophisticated technology along
it whatso ever.

Dirt Road~
This dirt road has been packed down by centurys of travel, is runs in either
direction for miles and to a town north of here. Its only about 8 feet wide
and has ruts worn into it from ceaseless cart travel. Over head is a small
canopy created by some fairly leafy trees.

Bridge~
say A long wooden planked bridge spans the small river here. It goes for about
40 feet before meeting the other side at a large gate built right up against
the river bank. The bridge itself looks sturdy enough to hold even the
heaviest cartloads without even the slightest creak or groan, the gate is also
made of heavy planking with metal strips bolted acrossed them.

Gatehouse~
This small structure is made from stones held together by a crude form of
mortar but appears to be relatively strong. At the southern side of it is a
heavy wood planked door and to the west is a small guard post from which you
can keep an eye on the bridge. The only other opening is to the north leading
out into the city.

Guardhouse~
This small guardhouse is made almost exclusively of bricks, including the roof,
you could almost call it a bunker. In the southeast wall is an archer slit
used for scaning the bridge and if need be warding off any unwanteds with a
hail of arrows. The ones in the rack look particularly nasty with sharps
points and barbs on them.

running along the inside of the town walls, to the south is a small gatehouse
leading out over a bridge and to your north is the main part of Wilksen.

at a resonably sized intersection, leading east is the residential area of
Wilksen, thanks to the extra income provided by the generous upper class of
Wilksen it was able to be paved with cobble stones rather than be left to
muddy up when it rains. Going north and south is a road running along the
inside of the eastern wall of Wilksen, west leading back into the heart of the
town. You notice that this entry/exit point of the city doesn't have a full
gate house, just a moderate sized wood gate that can be closed during a siege,
after all, wouldn't wanna lock the pub regulars from their homes at night.

are like this. The occasionally citizen moves by not really noticing you as
they go about their daily routine.

Wilksen town Bank~
This inside of this building shows the small influence outsiders have caused in
this town, instead of being the normal wood construct this building actually
uses more modern materials such as duraplast. In the back is a single
terminal, the only piece of technology here, which allows the clerks to adjust
peoples accounts. There are also a few older looking vaults where the old
tangible forms of curency were stored.

windows~
Since not so much light is coming in on this side at the moment you can study
the windows a bit closer without being blinded, you can easily make out the
picture of the last supper, an old story from one of the ancient human
religions.

is the rope you pull to ring the bells and leading around in the inside of the

There are several ropes here, likely for many different sized bells, in the
middle is a particularly thick one with lead counter wieghts on it, this one
must be for the largest of the bells.

You have passed beyond the storefront area of the smithy and are now standing
next to a large hot forge with a ceramic pan of molten metal in it, a
blacksmith stands near by getting ready to turn this bit of metal into an
object of some sort. His apprentice busilly gets more raw materials and works
the bellows to keep it all running.

Prison Cell~
You are in a small dark cell in the Wilksen prison, it appears well maintained
despite its dungeon atmosphere and is dry and warm. I guess these people take
care of their prisoners, on the wall written in several languages are the
instructions for posting bail..

Forest Path~
You see trees, lots of trees, and little paths running of in varios directions.
the sky is hidden from view so the direction of travel is hard to make out..
Its very hard to see the path even under your feet and you have a strong sense
of forboding that you shouldn't leave it. Around you are many choices of where
to tread but only a few will lead you to salvation.

Forest Clearing~
The trees and underbrush part in a small clearing here, off to the north of it
is a good sized cabin with a sign hanging in front of it declaring that it is
the Rhapsody Inn. A large chimney at the top is putting out a modest amount of
smoke so you are sure it has to be inhabited. It certainly looks more inviting
than the forest around you, perhaps you should stop in for a while?

Rhapsody Inn~
This is a cozy little inn, a ways above you are the rafters and the woodshingle
roof, all about you are a few tables, one &ztable&g in particular stands out
from the rest. Off to the east side of the room is the bar with the ever
watchful bartender standing behind it. Off to the west is a small stage with
&Rred&g velvet curtans drawn closed. By the bar is a wooden door leading
someplace and up against the north wall is a big fireplace with roaring
&Yfire&g. In one corner hangs a &Bhammock&g while in the other sits and old
worn &rarm chair&g belonging to some warrier of long ago.

it without having to scrunch.

Storeroom~
This is the backroom of the Inn where all the kegs of drink and crates of food
are kept. There is a small barrell serving as a table with a few small crates
around it for chairs, and on the table is a large pot of black coffee incase
any of the patrons need to be brought back here to sober up. Off against the
wall are a couple small cots as well for those so inebrated to not be able to
leave till the morning.

of the inn. Aside from the trees you get an incredible view of the sky and all
the stars at night.

Loft in the trees~
You have climbed up neer to the top of the tree cannopy, you find a old
platform build into the trees up here occupied by a very old hermit. He
appears to collect many things including old intact machinery and weapons from
the ancient war which nearly exterminated this planet and threw it back
technilogocally by thousands of years.

Alcove~
You have climbed up and are standing in one of the alcoves vacant of a statue.
From this vantage point you can see that the statues are lifesize and the
alcoves are big enough for about one person each with a comfortable distance
from the surrounding walls. This one is made from carefully carved &zgranite
stones &gthat interlock together almost perfectly.

granite stones~
As you examine the stones more carefully you notice that neear the top one is
depressed ever so slightly, you wonder if it would be possible to press the
stone in further, but then again why, after all this is only an alcove for a
statue, what real use would a mislaid stone be?

Granite tunnel~
You are now inside a small tunnel made entirely of polished black granite. You
examine the walls closely with your light and find that there are no more
seams that show where one brick ends and one starts, its as if this entire
tunnel was made of one large piece of stone. What little light produced is
reflected by the polished mirror of the surface so well it lights almost the
entire tunnel, your mind revolts against this though as the reflecting surface
is obviously black.

A Magical Workshop~
You step into a small cluttered room, all around you are small bits and pieces
of work in progress, you glance about and you notice a sizable workbenched
worked into the room long ways. You notice something off in the corner, as you
move further back into shop you come a sort of curtain pulled across part way
separating the last few feet of space in this place. Off to the back wall is a
door leading somewhere.

corner~
In the corner is an armor rack holding some very impresive pieces 
~
E
bench~
This work bench is long and from the look of the mars and scratches, very well
used. Upon it are some partially assembled suits of armor, a half forged sword
and a few oddities found only in major foundrys and work shops of the most
weathy kingdoms. 
~
E
door~
This door must be close to half a foot thick and is made from solid iron.
Acrossed it are several steel reinforcing braces about 4 inchs thick each.
This behemoth of a door is attached to the wall by 5 large steal hinges with
giant bolts going deep into the stone. The locking system is intricate in that
one large lever raises 3 thick and heavy latches but is ammazingly strong, as
you test the door thinking it would take 10 men to budge it, it swings gently
and quite easily open. 
~

#3549
backroom~
You have steped behind the curtains into a small back room, it messures only
about 7 feet wide and 8 feet deep but feels very comfortable. Before you is a
comfy looking bed with an old quilt laid out on it, something above the
headboard catches your eye and you look up in astonishment. Hanging above the
bed is the great Godblade, you wonder how it could have come to be in such a
place and then you think that the person who lives here couldn't possibly have
made it, could she?
