1 -PK- PK PKILL PKILLING~
&G&WPlayer Killing is legal on UR.  However please note the following:

If you kill a player who doesn't have a bounty on their head you better have a
very good reason for killing them. 

Killing a person because they are smuggling a crate or you overheard them 
asking someone to teach them how to &Yvandalize&G&W, &Ymake spice&G&W, or
&Ybomb planets &G&Ware not good reasons to kill, that's what the skills:
&Yjail&G&W, &Ytorture&G&W, or &Ystunning &G&W(beating them up) is for. 

In any case, the best would be to get the opinion of a PR imm of your kill
before acting.  Otherwise, repeated non-ic kills will get you slayed or banned
from UR. 

&RPlease Note&G&W: 

Newbie killing is greatly discouraged. 
Killing should always be kept in character.

-1 ADARI ADARIAN~
an alien race native to the planet Adari, the Adarians are humanoids with
unusual cranial structures. Their skulls are elongated and tall, and havea
large hole which goes completely through it. They have no ears or noses, and
their mouth is ringed with sharp, bony ridges instead of lips. The Adarians
make up to the lack of ears with a covering of fine hairs along their skulls
that pick up the vibration of sound waves. A series of glands near the skin's
surface allows them to smell. Their throats can be distended and filled with
air, and the resulting "long call" can be useful as a communication method or a
kind of defensive action. The Adarians have a rigid caste system which
dominates their society, and the have evolved an advanced technology based on
the use of super-cooled carbon-ice computers. They were able to remain neutral
during the Galactic Civil War by signing a non-agression treaty with the
Empire, providing the Empire with unlimited raw materials in return for their
neutrality.

101 ADVANCE~

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

101 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.

If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001

To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002

To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".

For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.

The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)

'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').

Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.

'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.

'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.

~

101 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.

Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic

6 ALGAROTH CONTINUIM~
The Algaroth Continuim appeared suddenly one evening by suprise. Their huge
capital spacecraft suddenly uncloaking in Sluivan and Hapan space. As the 
night guards on each planet gazed up their eyes filled with sudden fear as
thousands of shards of light and energy were released from both ships,
bombarding the planet to submission. The planetary defenses went up to late,
platenary patrol ships got into orbit just in time to witness three deadly 
vessels launch from the capital ships. As the three vessels got close to the
planets their own bays opened, releasing 10 incredibly fast fighters. The 
patrol ships were no match and the planets soon became overwhelmed. The 
Algaroth Continuim had risen to power. 
  
The AC inhabited both Sluis and Hapes and began their merge into the everyday
lives of the citizens. They formed their own goverment and their own military,
and stated a decree across galactic communications channels. That decree was
this, "We of the Continuim do not care about anyone elses problems, we care
not about wars or planetary disputes. All we wish is to live our lives as we
see fit without your pathetic interference. We have the firepower to blow you
aside, but we are not aggresive. Do not test us...for me may not have a desire
to expand, but we will certainly retaliate." 
  
&Y&G&W - Basically put, they do not care about other planets, other clans, or
other wars. They do not want to expand their reaches or empire. They just wish
to be left alone. But...they will fight back if you push into what they have
claimed.

think I need to continue to ramble lets make this simple.
Good Hearted Align = Good Hearted Actions

1 ARAHAT~
------ 
The Arahat are a half-breed race. They are found only when two other races mate
and parent an offspring. Depending on the parents genetics, most Arahat are of
a mild to short stature and have a light weight. With their thin and nimblue
frames they are mildly strong and dexterious with a slight setback in their
constitution and wisdom.
  
Most Arahat, being of exotic mix's, have a thin coat of hair covering their
entire body. Much like the neandrathal human, their fur is no more then oddly
long hair on their skin. Since they are a mix, the Arahat seem to be more
adept to adopt their parents more shady habits then their good ones, making
them some of the lesser liked people in the galaxy.

-1 ASKANI~
ASKANI 
------ 
The Askani are a enormously framed feline race. Born on the planet of Ask'an
in a remote sector of the universe, their entire society revolves around their
tribe. With no central government or leadership, they roam the planet in 
nomadic herds, each tribe is unique in that its appearance represents a 
specific type of feline species. Each tribe has different characteristics yet
all share the huge height and wide shoulders. 
  
Askani are born and bred on the ideals of truth and honor. No Askani would 
every even consider an illegal act or helping anyone who would. Askani do not
lie or stretch the truth in even the slightest. Their sense of pride and honor
simply will not allow it. 
  
Though they make good ground combatants, Askani feel their true calling in the
cockpit of a spacecraft. They are excellent pilots in both piloting and air 
combat. It is said that the true nature of the askani can be seen when he or 
she is concentrated on an intense air battle. 
------ 
  
&Y* &WNote - There are &RNO&W exceptions to this character layout. There are no
rogue or renegade Askani PERIOD! If you cannot RolePlay the above outline word
for word, then you need to choose another race. 
  
&Y* &WNote - Also, all Askani names are gutteral and animalistic in its sound.
An example of one is Goreece, which would be pronounced, Gorrr-reeeee-ce. 
Askani do tend to slur their R's a little, much like the Spanish do in their 
language.

0 AUCTION~
Syntax: auction
Syntax:	auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax:	auction bid <value>
Syntax:	auction stop

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing
auction will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.

If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it will start at 0
gold.

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item, and
auction stop (immortals only) will stop an auction in progress.

Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported here from a publicly available source.)

At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both
your bidded money and the item.  This will soon be fixed.

You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction until level THREE or higher.  To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

105 'BAN NEWBIE'~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site. 
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make 
sure you have exhausted all other options first.  
  
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's  
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have  
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it  
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their  
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues 
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

~

0 BOTHAN BOTHANS~
.&G&WThe fur-covered Bothans developed their natural talents through a
peculiar form of cultural evolution. Predators such as the krak'jya are
numerous on their homeworld of Bothawui, but draft animals never emerged.
Advancing armies, forced to haul their own equipment, provisions, and
heavy armamanets, quickly grew disgusted at this inefficient method of
combat. Eventually, the Bothans learned to defeat the enemy from within.
Over the centuries, the aliens became masters at gathering intelligence
and exploiting it for political gain. Bothan statesmen rarely fall to
assassin's blades, but they often step down when their allies suddenly
desert them or when an ugly scandal is deliberately brought to light.

This ruthless pursuit of power and influence, known as the "Bothan Way", causes
many non-Bothans to view these species as untrustworthy opportunists waiting
to pounce on the slightest misstep.  It is precisely this environment of
mutual suspicion that has made the Bothan Spynet the finest in the galaxy.
Just before the Battle of Endor, the Bothan Spynet uncovered evidence that a
freighter was carrying top-secret Imperial information. They intercepted this
freighter, many of them dying in the process. Further deaths followed as the
computer core made its way to the nearby Kothlis system, and into the hands of
Rebel Alliance leaders. The decoded data revealed the location of the
unfinished second Death Star. Mon Mothma proudly announced this to the
spirited Alliance war room, but she took care to remember the tragic cost.
"Many Bothans", she explained in a hushed voice, "died to bring us this
information."

1 BUILDINFO~
&YWhat Building is: 
&R---------------------------------------------------------------&w 
&R&WWhat is building? Building is creating a world. Taking little  
things in life, such as the texture of a piece of cloth or the  
smell of a market square on Sunday. Building isn't about three   
lines of exit description, it's about making the player feel as though 
they are sitting in the cantina conversing with famed bounty  
hunters, or flying a TIE Fighters in tight formation. It's not  
just creating a world, it's making the world you're creating   
come alive. I don't expect you to give me a disseration for   
every room, but what I do expect if for you to make the world  
come alive. It doesn't matter if you use big words, or complex  
sentence structure, it's about using the language to convince  
someone that what they are reading about is in front of their face.   
This isn't easy to do, you'll see people on other MUDs writing  
out things like Their's a door to the north for a description, what's 
that? Why isn't it A door, with a shining brass knocker and kickplate, 
waits for someone to push it open and enter through it's oaken frame? 
The answer is because some people don't care about the player, they  
only care about how far they can advance for every area completely,  
here on Unknown Regions, you need to care about the player, and   
give that extra effort. 
~

1 BUILDREQ~
&YGeneric Building Requirements for Unknown Regions: 
&R--------------------------------------------------------------&w 
&C&cOur general guidelines....... 
  
&R&W1) Planning out a area/planet is a good thing.. 
Graphpaper is your best friend! 
  
2)  Please, Use correct spelling and grammar 
Do not let the Curse of Durga(TM) affect you! 
  
3) Description Quality: Room Descriptions should be at least 
4-5+ lines on average and no more then 12 lines.. it creates alot 
of spam. I do not want to see alot of repeat descriptions. This shows a  
lazy builder. You can easily put in an extra line or change a few words 
or even better, make 3 - 5 descs and alternate for tunnels/streets and 
such. The only time solid repeat descs will be acceptable is in a maze. 
  
4) Logical Linking: Remember that your area must make sense when 
you make it, the exits have to be cohesive and sucessive. Meaning
no jumps from like an arctic circle to a tropical island so quickly. 
This does not mean your area has to be simple, Just logical. 
  
5) Programs, Extra descs: Interaction is good 
  
6) Theme: Make sure your planet follows the description at jimfisher.net or the
book it is in. It needs to be at least partially accurate in theme. 
  
7) Good things to know/read: Star Wars Movies/Books

1 BUILDTIPS~
&YBuilding Tips and Hints: 
&R----------------------------------------------------&w 
&C&cThese are just miscellanous things that help 
when making an area&w 
  
&R&W1)Imagination - No explanation needed 
  
2)Curiosity - Ask not, Get not, The more you ask, the more you learn.
  
3)Patience - This is especially needed for novices and "experts" alike.
most likely your first area you crank out if your new most likely will
not be the best area in the world, It's a learning process, You take 
criticism(constructive). and learn from your past mistakes. and lastly
biulding a good area can be/is very tedious, parts of it aren't that fun
but necessary, If you take the time to do things well, People will notice
it and it will stand out. 
  
4) Common Sense and Pride - When building remember all the things you 
disliked about other areas you've seen to build guidelines for yourself if
you don't have any.  ie, don't you hate walking west in a hallway that has
a description narrating about someone going east? Rooms with all the same
descs aren't that good either, If your going for long streets, you can do 
subtle changes to make them different or even better, make 3 - 5 different 
ones and alternate. Even though "most" players may not look at  
descriptions  doesn't mean it should not be done. and learn to take pride 
in your work, Don't bash your work, you get better with everything you do.

-1 DEFEL "AF'EL"~
Defel are an Alien species that appear as large, red-eyed shadows under most
lighting conditions. This has given rise to their common name:
Wraiths. Under Ultraviolet light, Defels appear as stocky, fur-covered bipeds
with protruding snouts and long, clawed, triple-jointed fingers.
They stand about 1.3 meters tall, with shoulders as wide as 1.2 meters across.
This species lives in underground cities on the planet Af'El, where most
inhabitants make their living through mining and metallurgy. In the galaxy at
large, Defel often find employment as hired muscle, spies, and assassins due to
their shadowy forms.

Defels can't wear armor because it would interfere with their natural
invisibility.  However the fact that they are nearly impossible to see makes
them very difficult to hit.

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and

 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;

 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.

 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).

 - success chances with bash and stun, and helps determine whether a thief
   will be able to poison a weapon.

Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)

          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science

~

101 DND~
On or off syntax: DND 
  
This command toggles your personal dnd flag. 
This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level.  
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In 
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room. 
  
When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto', 
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD  
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To  
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'. 
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND 
  
The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands 
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only 
in effect if: 
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on. 
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the 
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.

about ten meters long. Large, reptilian scales cover their bodies, though they
have floppy, mammallike ears. Each body segment has a pair of legs, though the
limbs attached to the foward segments have evolved into arms and hands. This
ancient species comes from a secret, unknown world. They can be encountered on
all types of worlds and even in deep space, where it seems they n eed to
artificial protection. The Star Dragons have a deep-rooted sense of morality
and honor, and most have at least some sensitivity to the Force. There are even
tales that tell of an ancient time when Duinuoqwuin served as Jedi Knights.

Because of their enormous size Duinouqwuin cannot wear armor. However they
have excellent hit points and regeneration rate. They also fave the unique
ability to fly. They are also very strong in the force.
~

1 E~
.              GROUPING WITH OTHER PLAYERS
              -----------------------------
If you are within 5 levels of another character, you have the ability
to group with that player.  You are not able to group a non-deadly
and a deadly character however (see HELP DEADLY). When you are grouped
with another player, you attack mobs together and share the experience
for each kill.

Group Commands:

  *FOLLOW <player> - you will follow that player at which point they group you
                   - to remove yourself from group type: FOLLOW <your name>

  *GROUP <player> - you add that player to your group
                  - typing GROUP alone will list the people in your group
                  - to remove someone from group type: GROUP <player name>

  *GTELL <message> - you tell the group a message

  *SPLIT <amount> - splits the gold among the group

~

0 EAT DRINK~
Syntax:  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink container)
Syntax:  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)

Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.

Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.

When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.

If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

101 ECHO RECHO~

~

101 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.

The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).

To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.

The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).

Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).

Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

See ASET, FOLDAREA

the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.

If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this
occurs the AC on that item is damaged by one permanently.  You cannot
repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."

-1 EWOK ENDOR~
The Curious, furred bipeds native to Endor's forest moon are called Ewoks.
Standing about one meter tall, the tribal Ewoks have yet to advance beyond
spears and bows, but their understanding of forest lore and survival skills
cannot be matched by a more advanced species. These Hunter gatherers live in
village clusters built high within the moon's giant trees. Easily startled, the
Ewoks are nonetheless brave, alert, and loyal, and they can be fierce warriors
when necessary. The Ewok language is liquid and expressive, and most humans and
other aliens can learn to speak it. Ewoks, conversely can learn Basic, though
they often mix in many words from their own language. During the day, Ewoks
come down out of their tree villages to hunt and forage on the forest floor. At
night, the forest belongs to huge carnivores, and even the youngest Ewoks know
not to venture out after dark. The Ewoks' mystical beliefs contain many
references to the Force, though it is never named as such. They are a musical
species, are overly curious, and are loyal to their tribes and friends.

~

101 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

101 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.

You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a power through real world usage

You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some powers (energy drain, etc.)
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.

Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

to travel through areas which require you to fly, however.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax:  cast 'fly' <character>

mv (movement points), preventing a character from falling when in the
air, moving over water or through the air, and in preventing an opponent
from tripping you.

'follow self'.  You cannot follow those more than ten levels above you.

'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.

If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.

'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.

'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.

by someone with access to player files.

~

101 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>

Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,

0 FURNITURE~
Syntax: <action> <object>
It is now possible to sit/stand/sleep/rest on/in/at properly created pieces
of furniture.  All you have to do is find a piece of furniture that is
working properly and just type sit chair
if it was a chair.  If you can sit on it, it will allow you to either sit
on/in/at it.
Furniture are objects you can interact with like sit down, lay down
such as beds, couches, sofas, etc etc. Before you ask for a piece.
Make sure you decide what you want it to look like.
Example -







~

101 FURNITUREVALUES FVALUES FVALUE~
It is now possible to sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture.
Here is how all of this works.

value2 - sit/sleep/rest/stand on furniture (more below)

As for value2, it uses bitvictors, and here are their numbers

SIT ON -    1        SIT IN -    2        SIT AT -    4
STAND ON -  8        STAND IN -  16       STAND AT -  32
SLEEP ON -  64       SLEEP IN -  128      SLEEP AT -  256
REST ON -   512      REST IN -   1024     REST AT -   2048

Furniture is set using the v2 setting and through adding the
values to make it work.  Say you want SIT ON and STAND IN, you
would add 1 and 16 and get 17.

A quick note, you can only be on in at an object.  If you
set all 3 of them to lets say Sit, when type type sit
object, they will sit at the object.  So only select
one.

1 GAMORREAN GAMORREANS~
The Gamorrean people are known for their brutish, porcine appearance,
along with their great strength and minute intelligence.  Green skinned
with pig-like snouts, they are among the Galaxy's best laborors and
mercenaries. They also have impressive stamina, allowing them to with-
stand large assaults and physical trauma.

When Gamorr was discovered, the populace was enslaved.  Those who
escaped this fate quickly traveled offworld to sell their services to
outsiders as guards and mercenaries.  Now, thanks to their superb idiocy,
they have been abandoned as a source of slave labor.

-1 GOTAL~
A Gotal is any member of the intelligent, technologically advanced, bipedal
 species from the moon called Antar Four.  They have two cone-shaped
growths rising from their heads, flat noses, protruding brows, and shaggy
gray fur.  The head cones  serve as additional sensory organs, able to
pick up and distinguish different forms of energy waves.  Most other
species feel uncomfortable around Gotals because of their additional
senses.  For their part, Gotals do not like droids due to the high-energy
output they give off, which tends to overload the Gotal's senses.  They
have a hard time interpreting the emotions of other alien species, often
mistaking affection for love and anger  for hatred.  They make excellent
scouts, bounty hunters, trackers, and mercenaries, though they tend to try
 to remain neutral in the galactic conflict.
~

101 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

will be selected if you do not specify a page.

NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player prompt.  &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.

101 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>

The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."

Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>

This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them.

Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.

Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>

Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:

HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.

REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.

REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.

101 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>

example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html

home page.

To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.

 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page

Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in powercasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:

       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

-1 HUMAN HUMANS~
Humans are the most numerous and least unusual of the races.  They possess
no special abilities or bonuses, but also have no penalties.  Because of
this, Humans are extremely adaptable and are able to assume a variety of
classes and roles.

Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish head.
Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look different from each the
other; almost none look exactly alike.

~

0 HUNTERS~
As of now, I issue a decree that all the members of the Hunters Guild
will vote for their new leader. I have heard complaints that they've no
leader, and have decided to take action of it. If you will, send us votes
in note form, telling us who you want as leader. We will take the member
with the most votes and he will be leader. Here are the simple rules.
1. No voting for yourself!
2. No voting twice!
~

-1 HUTT HUTTS~
An obese race, the Hutts are among the Galaxy's most despicable low-lifes.
They live on their adopted homeworld of Nal Hutta, having completely
strip-mined their original home.  Due to their great size, they lack any
appreciable dexterity, however such size does lend itself to some added
protection. In addition, many have keen minds and a good deal of common
sense, probably due to the fact that they are constantly trying to kill
one another.

Centering their entire lives around the aquisition of power and wealth,
their is little art, of any type, associated with them.  Some do, however,
keep collections for mere boasting value.

1 HYPERSPACE~
.
 Syntax :  Calculate (system) (x) (y) (z)
             Then Hyperspace

Hyperspace is used to jump from one system to another in the

as well as a bit more dangerous. If you get a Jump warning
odds are you will collide with something when you jump into
the system

1 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if;you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

1 IGNORE~
Syntax:  ignore 
Syntax:  ignore <character> 
Syntax:  ignore reply/none 
  
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however. 
  
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring. 

Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for 
them to be logged on at the time. 
  
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you. 
  
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.

with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect. 
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from. 
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows 
for multiple hosts for a certain name. 
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

189 IMMORTAL~
-------- 
  
Hello there, if you are reading this you are either a new Immortal or a old one
refreshing their memory. This file is designed to assist you in understanding
your role as a Staff Member of the Unknown Regions. 
  
There are three types of active Immortals in the Unknown Regions. Those are as
follows. 
  
Builders - Those Imm's responsible for providing new area's and items. 
PR - Those Imm's who directly interact with Mortal Players or problems.
Admin - The Boss Men/Women of the Mud.
  
Each Non-Admin Division has a Head, and THAT is the Immortal you answer to. You
will obey any instructions given from a Head of Division or an Admin Imm.
  
&W--------------------&g 
  
Currently the number of Immortals we have must coincide with the limits we have
set. These limits are designed to make sure we are not just a Mud full of
Imm's. 
  
&PPR &WImm &GTotal &W- 1 Head, 4 subordinates

Syntax: feel infravision <character>

This power enables the target character to see other players and mobiles
that are in the room with them.  This power will also allow you to get
items from a corpse, but will not allow you to see the corpse.  You
must have a light source to see items, room descriptions, or "exits" in
a dark room.
~

101 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax:  installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).

Installarea renames the installed area file from 'author.are.file' to
'author.are.installed' so that the builder may be assigned new vnums.

~

1 INSTALLPART~

following:
       installpart <Ship Name> <part>
to find out the parts, just type installpart
~

101 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom

Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.

Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]

This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.

NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.

See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:

 - heavily influences the amount of force a character gains at level

 - affects the amount of force regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping

 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or power

 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language

Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...

~

103 'INVADE ESSENCE'~
&BForce Spell: Invade Essence
Force Level: 10
Syntax: feel 'invade essence' <target>

Early forcers succumbing to the Dark Side may use this spell, to push into

105 IPCOMPARE~
Syntax: ipcompare <name> 
        ipcompare <site> 
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#> 
  
This takes * as a wild card. 
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive 
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows 
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously. 
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return 
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk. 
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that 
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that 
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area 
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area 
you are in.

-1 ITHORIAN~
The species name for the aliens commonly referred to as Hammerheads is
Ithorian.  Their common name comes from their T-shaped heads, which rest
atop long, curved necks.  Ithorians come from the Ottega star system, in
the Lesser Plooriod Cluster.  They speak Basic with a strange twist due to
 their two mouths, each located on one side of their necks.  This
generates  a stereo effect, which produces one of the most beautiful and
difficult  native languages in the galaxy.  Ithor, the fourth planet in
the Ottega  system, is a jungle world that the Ithorians have learned to
respect and  even worship.  The ecologically minded species believes that
only their  eco-priests should ever set foot upon the ground of the great
Mother   Jungles.  The rest live within great floating herd cities.
Herbivores,  Ithorians never take more than they need from their planet
and they  practice a system of planting two trees for every one they are
required to take from the jungles.   Some herd cities have been converted
to starships and equipped with hyperdrives.  In this way, Ithorian
caravans travel the space lanes, bringing unusual merchandise from place
to place.  The herd  ships are built to mimic the  environment the
Ithorians know, complete  with indoor jungles, artificial storms, examples
of Ithorian wildlife, and vast corridors of lush vegetations. Ithorians
are a gentle, peace-loving  species.  They have great respects for all
forms of life.  hey are a  gregarious and curious people, who enjoy their
roles as space merchants  almost as much as ecological preservers.  In the
Outer Rim Territories,   the arrival of a herd ship is cause for
celebration.

1 JEDICODE~
I stumbled upon this in the same book that the race files for basic swr is
located in, word for word the race files are, and so i will put this in
word for word.


The Jedi Code is the philosphy that sums up the beliefs
of the Jedi Knights:

"There is no emotion; there is peace.
There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.
There is no passion; there is serenity
There is no death; there is Force."

A Jedi does not act for personal power or wealth but seeks
knowledge and enlightenment.  A Jedi never acts from hatred,
anger, fear, or aggression but acts when calm and at peace
with the Force

1 JOKE~
Ok, here's a funny joke. There was this woman pregnant with triplets.
Inside her tummy, the three were discussing about what they wanted to do
later in life. The first one said, "I wanna be a Plumber when I grow up."
The other two look at him and ask why. "Because it's leaky in here and I
want to fix it." They nod. The second one says, "I wanna be an
electrician."   The other two ask him why. "Because it's too dark in here
and I wanna fix it."  They nod. The third one says, "I wanna be a boxer!"
They look at him and say "How the heck will you support yourself?!"  He
says, "I dunno." So they ask him why he wants to be one. He says, "Well
cuz, if that thing pops in here one more time and spits in my face, I'm
gonna POP that thing with my fist!"

Try Joke2 for another one.

1 JOKE2~
Sometimes it DOES take a Rocket Scientist

Scientists at NASA have developed a gun built specifically to
launch dead chickens at the windshields of airliners, military
jets and the space shuttle, all traveling at maximum velocity.
The idea is to simulate the frequent incidents of collisions with
airborne fowl to test the strength of the windshields.   British
engineers heard about the gun and were eager to test it on the
windshields of their new high speed trains.
Arrangements were made. But when the gun was fired, the
engineers stood shocked as the chicken hurtled out of the barrel,
crashed into the shatterproof shield, smashed it to smithereens,
crashed through the control console, snapped the engineer's
backrest in two and embedded itself in the back wall of the cabin.
Horrified Britons sent NASA the disastrous results of the
experiment, along with the designs of the windshield, and begged
the U.S. scientists for suggestions. NASA's response was just one
sentence,  "Thaw  the chicken."

0 KICK GOUGE PUNCH BASH~
.&G&W&rCombat &WSkill: &YKick&W, &YGouge&W, &YPunch&W, &YBash 
 &rCombat &WLevel: 6, 25, 28, 40 
 &G&WSyntax: &YKick&W, &YGouge&W, &YPunch&W, &YBash &W(while fighting) 
  
&G&WThese skills allow &rcombatants &Wto vary fighting skills while fighting.
&YKicking&W, &YGouging&W, &YPunching&W, or &YBashing &Wwill do more damage
then simply &Ykilling&W. 

&YGouge &Wwill temporarily blind your opponent. 

&YBash &Wcan only be used once a fight has started.  It will inflict damage and
temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two 
rounds during which you cannot heal, flee or perform other extraneous  
&Wactions (i.e. you will be able to dodge/parry/attack but nothing else). 
These same consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a
player-character, otherwise the skill only inflicts damage. 

 &RNote&W: &YKick&W, &YPunch&W, and &YBash &W have the possibility of breaking
       bones. 

 &RNote&G&W: &YBash &Whas a drastically reduced chance of hitting if the basher
       is not one of the primary targets (ie. is not tanking).

101 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:

&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.

&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.

Valid numeric values are:

&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

~

101 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.

Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

&YMobile Building Requirements for Unknown Regions:  
&R------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
&C&cMisc Guidelines for building mobs 
  
&R&W1) Use your Common Sense. 
  
2) Most mobiles should have descriptions 
  
3) Mob programs are good, interaction is very good 
  
4) Setting things like its race/sex is good. 
  
5) Use a large variety of mobs in your area. 
  
6) Clothes are very good for mobs. Not 
every single person is going to wear 
armor. 
  
7) More to come later

forced to buy a module for everything.

Install_module is the command used to install the modules. Syntax:
install_module (module) (shipname) The only modules you can install
more then one of are lasers, missiles, torpedos, rockets, fuel pods.

your ship

To remove a module. The syntax is :remove_module (module) (ship name)
For more further information on modules see help modules2.

-1 MON CALAMARI CALAMARIS~
The Mon Calamari are a race of shore-dwelling bipeds.  Living on a planet
almost totally covered with oceans, they have developed a symbiotic
relationship with the water-dwelling Quarren.  These inhabitants of the sea
mine ore from the ocean's floor and the Mon Calamari design practical uses
for it.  While they are not the most agile or tough race, their long
fight against the Empire has taught them many survival skills.

When the Empire came to Mon Calamari, it decimated the population and their
proliferate floating cities.  After months of fighting, the Imperial force
was repelled and the first collective action of the planet was to seek entry
into the Alliance.  The Mon Calamari also provided a great asset to the
Alliance during the war, converting their numerous Pleasure Cruisers into
machines of war, bringing much needed capitol ships to the Aliiance's forces.

when it goes mobinvis; they cannot see it with any power, it will be
completely invisible to them.

Be warned, however, that its programs will still function as normal, the
mortal will simply see a 'someone' if it performs an action or an echo

1 MULTIPLAYER MULTIPLAYING MULTI MULTIPLAY~
&RMultiplaying is Illegal&w 
&CDefinition of Multiplaying:&w 
&B------------------------------------&w 
&R&WHaving access to or owning more then *1* character unless it is 
Your Child 
  
Having two or more characters connected and controlled by you at the 
same time(Regardless of link dead or not). 
  
Having the two characters interact in any way(dropping a item and other 
one picking it up even after its quit). 
  
Using another character to extract revenge 
  
&YPunishments :&w 
&B-----------------&w 
These will depend on the mood of the imm who caught you. 
Best advice is to *NOT* multiplay. Its not my fault if 
one imm who is semi-nice just slays your other char and 
does a few things to you while another more strict imm 
just slays both of you off hand. Its not a issue of fairness 
Its a Issue of breaking the rules.

Well done!

~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder...

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL10_~
You are all powerful!
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy!

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...

You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful!

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...

You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

0 NAME NAMES~
&YSyntax:  name <newname>&W 
  
This command allows a pre-authorization player to change their name to
a new one if their original choice has been denied. 
  Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Joe', Pete would simply type: &YName Joe&W. 
  
When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both Starwarsish
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should &YNOT &Wbe:&G 
  
 - Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous. 
 - Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language. 
 - Futuristic or common, such as 'Jill' or 'Laser'. 
 - Similar to that of any UR Immortal, major mob, or equipment. 
 - Significant in history, mythology, or any religion. 
 - Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.
 - Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'. 
 - Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives, 
    as in 'Heart', 'Big', 'Flying', 'Broken', 'Slick' or 'Tricky'. 
 - Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Jade as 'Edaj'. 
 - Any combination of singular descriptive nouns/adverbs or adjectives, as
   in 'Metaljacket Heartbound Earthstone or Softheart'. 
  
&WPlease keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do 
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines 
which all immortals follow. In addition, they may have their own 
reasons for denying your name. The final determination as to the 
validity of a name on UR is the discretion of the Immortals 
and is NOT subject to debate or discussion. If your name is denied, 
simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.

1 NAMES~
.
The name of your character is very important.  As we are trying
to keep this a Role Play Mud please pick reasonable names.
Names of wee known start wars characters are frownd upon
and names with profanity or just plain stupid will be denied.

i.e. Luke, Vader, Han are well known names.
i.e  Fish Head, Supermanguy, are just plain stupid.

1 NEWCLAN~
To make a new clan, You need to submit and application to a imm 
containing 
What your clan is, Clan's name, Its IC stuff like story etc 
and all those kind of details 
  
Then make it unofficial, once you have 4 - 8 ACTIVE members in your  
clan for at least 2 - 3 weeks, Then your clan will be considered by 
squall to be made into a real one with ships etc. 
&RIf you have any questions about my requirements for the application 
then you might as well not go about it cause they are not hard. I will 
not answer any questions on them. You shouldn't start a clan if you 
can't even answer those simple questions. 
  
&YDon't even bother submitting an application if you can't RP, write 
a good story or IC info cause I don't take half-assed shit. Example 
of a shitty application: 
  
Super powerful Force 
a team of strong people that protect people 
We are strong people from all over the galaxy who like to do good

-1 NOGHRI~
The Noghri are a race of great hunters and warriors.  Incredible agility
lend them a large advantage in combat.  For the most part, Noghri are
not technologically advanced, they lack any sort of "street smarts," as
almost none of them have ever gone offworld, and those that do only do so
as body guards and similar occupations.  Their small size also limits their
constition, and thus succumb to wounds more quickly than humans.

The Noghri live on the fourth planet in their system, the only one of seven
capable of supporting life.  Honoghr is, for the most part, a barren world.
Years ago, during the Clone Wars, a large starship crashed into the planet,
causing massive destruction and posoining much of the planet with coolant
fluids. Since, the Noghri have been extremely dependant on the Empire or
the New Republic for food.

100 NOKILL KILL NO~
A 'nokill' flag has been added for NAMED mobs. It doesn't make sense
for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones
with names as opposed to ones like anonymous stormtroopers etc ).
This flag will cause the mob that has it to appear to flee before it
dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around.

recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE TAKE takes the note as in NOTE REMOVE, as well as physically taking
it in your inventory.

Notes now require a blank message disk to record :)

105 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in 
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the 
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen. 
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They 
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from 
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time 
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the 
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage  
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated. 
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage 
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula 
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage 
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it  
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>. 
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage 
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally 
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above 
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number. 
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>) 
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty 
stomach. 
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage 
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A 
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this 
stage more wait time is added with the following formula: 
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5, 
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it. 
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage 
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with  
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula 
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following: 
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power 
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive 
spells. 
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage 
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to 
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the 
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6

Stage 8:  The Speech Stage 
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and 
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works 
on a percentage with the following formula: 
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2 
speech is scrambled 40% of the time. 
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage 
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the  
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10 
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage 
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate). 
This is done on a percentage of the following: 
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the 
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.

&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player. 
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim. 
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows: 
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w 
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days. 
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the 
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be 
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty. 
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.
  
&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used. 
&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5 
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being 
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like: 
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the 
first example.

4) No Crystals should be created without contacting 
the creation council head first. 
  
5) No easy to obtain armor should be more powerful 
then anything a engineer is capable of creating. 
  
6) Use weight, if a weapon is a huge ass rifle, its 
bound to be heavy. 
  
7) Keep the word balance in mind at all times when making

Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

can be destroyed by bombing, This is meant to make conquering planets
a little more of a challenge. 
  
&CUsage : Order Planet (item) 
Items are Shield, Barracks, Controls 
~

101 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.

Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.

If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.

OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:

        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

1 PATROCINOR1 BIO1~
Patrocinor has lead a long, very long life. Most people have never heard of the
planet that Patrocinor lived on, Scarlettica, on which he was a retainor for a
Noble family, the Dawnbreakers. Life was good until an advanced alien species,
a nameless race of aliens with advanced psionic powers, invaded the planet. In
a fierce battle to save the planet from the onslaught of aliens, the entire 
Dawnbreaker family took up arms agains the alien force. 
The Family, along with the Planetary Defense Force suffered heavy casualties,
and barely managed to beat back the invading forces. Almost the entire 
Dawnbreaker Family died, except for Patrocinor and Brutus, the young family 
son. Among the casualties was Patrocinor's Duinuogwuin wife, Carus, who was 
pregnant at the time. She had chose not to fight but a rouge bomb ended up 
killing her. Patrocinor was heartbroken over the loss of his wife and the 
Dawnbreaker Family. Wishing to protect young Brutus, Patrocinor sent him ahead
to the relatively safer Inner Rim, and stayed behind to protect the planet in
case of a second wave. Fortunately the Second Wave never came, and the planet
was able to enter a time of prosperity under the new reconstruction. Sastified
with the turn for the better on Scarlettica, he returned to the inner rim in
search of Brutus, only to find that Brutus had been killed by an Evil Sith 
Lord. 
Brutus had acted nobely and was aiding a Duinuogwuin Jedi Knight, the Sith 
hated the interference with the plans and killed young Brutus, and 
disappeared. 
~

1 PATROCINOR2 BIO2~
Heartbroken over the loss of the last of the Dawnbreakers Patrocinor, and 
having nothing to return to on Scarlettica, he opted to stay in the inner rim.
He became very lonely and very depressed, until one day a fellow Duinuogwuin 
approached him, it was very rare to see a fellow member of his race and let 
alone a female one. Her name was Malystryx and in a lot of ways she reminded 
Patrocinor of his long lost Carus. Malystryx had noticed Patrocinor and felt 
an amount of pity for him, she encouraged him to join the Imperial Remnants 
with her, Patrocinor gladly joined, but lost touch of Malystryx in the 
confusion of the Post Endor Reformation of the Imperial Remnants. Losing track
of Malystryx Only made him more depressed, but Patrocinor carried on. 
The Empire reformed and Veroon took the place of Leader. Patrocinor carried on
with his job until Veroon took notice of him and promoted him to captain. A 
position which Patrocinor still gladly serves. Patrocinor also feels the need
to protect those who are innocent. He was a General in the War of the Leagues,
and fought back against the rioters on two occasions, once paying the ultimate
sacrafice and losing his life, thankfully he had a clone, and was able to make
a recovery. He still wishes to get revenge against the human league and looks
for a way to do so. 
Patrocinor has a few friends but not that many, a lot of people are intimidated
by his enormous size and dragon-like appearance.  He considers Ruby Valos and 
Joan De-Ark close friends, he also looks up to Priest Slicer for advice. He 
respects Jek Veroon, Priestess Katrina, and Tempest McCloud a lot. 
~

1 PATROCINOR3 BIO3~
Patrocinor still remains lonely, he feels the loss of his family and his 
friends every day and considers himself deep down a failure. He had sworn to 
protect the Dawnbreakers and his Wife and failed. He tries to make up for this
by protecting those who can not protect themsleves, but he still remains sad 
and old. He tries not to let this show to others but people can see it in the
eyes, he is a weathered dragon and feels a lot of pain. 
~

1 PATROCINOR4 BIO4~
It's amazing how much can change in a short period of time, in a short period
of time Patrocinor's lonely life was thrown backward. More and more people
started showing concern for Patrocinors Mental health. Joan tried to cheer him
up by taking him to Rone's place, but it didn't work, Patrocinor seemed
eternally lonely.
It's amazing how much can change in a short period of time, in a short period
of time Patrocinor's lonely life was thrown backward. More and more people
started showing concern for Patrocinors Mental health. Joan tried to cheer him
up by taking him to Rone's place, but it didn't work, Patrocinor seemed
eternally lonely.
All this changed One day. Patrocinor was in the Starlight Chapel remembering
all those he loved that he had lost, he remembered a lot of names, Marcus,
Rose, Chi'Ka, little Brutus, but most of all His sweet Carus. He had set their
for several hours when he became aware of soemone next to him. He had dozed
off and the person had snuck in. He looked over and almost as if from a dream,
his Carus had returned to him. 
She had been searching for him for 7 years, and had finally found him, with
thanks to Joan De-Ark of the Imperial Remnants. He found out that she had
barely managed to survive the bomb and had been lost under rubble.
Unfortunately she had lost the unborn baby in the explosion.
After several years of being in coma, folllowed by recovery and intensive care
she was finally able to go seek out her lost husband. After many years they
were reunited! 
~

1 PATROCINOR5 BIO5~
Patrocinor decided that since they were starting a new life together they
should get remarried. A bounce was put back into Patrocinor's step. He
regained a lost sense of purpose, he seemed happier. 
He also began to meet new people now that he wasn't a manic depressed dragon.
He became friends with Sariss, and Alexia Corvis. He also met Ensign Cedric
from the Imperial Remnants. He saw in Cedric something that he saw in himself.
Cedric was alone and hurt, he didn't know where he came from. Patrocinor
feeling the same when he was a Whepling.A bond formed betweem the two.
Patrocinor grew closer to Cedric and considers him the son he never had, the
son he lost on Scarlettica.  
Before Patrocinor knew it, his wedding day had arrived. All of the preparation
was finished, and he was ready. Or he thought he was. His wedding ended up
with almost circus like qualities. The best man, Cedric, was being detained by
authorities, the priest had an emergency and couldn't make it, someone was
robbed, he spent hours looking for a priest and found two who both wanted to
do it and almost got in fight with each other for it, Pat forgot to get a ring
for himself, and Carus grew ill. The reception was a bit better, when
Patrocinor announced officially that he had adopted Cedric and that Cedric was
now an official Dawnbreaker.
But disastor soon struck Cedric. In what can only be called  one of the Worst
Cases of Medical Malpractice ever, Cedric's legs were replaced with Implants.
Patrocinor has to deal with the anger his new son has, and along with the much
needed help of Alexia and Sariss, help his son deal with his loss. 
~

1 PATROCINOR6 BIO6~
For his faithful service in the Imperial Remnants Patrocinor recived a
promotion to Moff and was appointed as the Governer of Corellia. Promoted by
Alexia, who replaced Jek Veroon as Supreme Commander of the Imperial Remnants,
Patrocinor continued to serve his Organization with honour. However, Alexia
soon Disappeared, and the Imperial Remnants lacked a leader.
Patrocinor was offered the job, and though many had perished before in the
Position, Patrocinor accepted it.  Patrocinor worked hard in his new Position,
always on the go, making visits to Planets, always with the intent on making
the People happy. 
Patrocinor soon met Cinna Duma, a troubled kid, who was an Ace Pilot. The two
became close, and Patrocinor adopted Cinna to the family as well. The
Dawnbreakers it would Appear, were finally growing. 
He worked out a Peace Accord with the Hapan Consortium. He also helped
re-arrange the internal structure of the Imperial Remnants. Soon, however,
disastor would strike. A radical group Known as the Terran Confederation rose
up and started attacking Imperial Planets and Civillians.
The Imperial Remnants was easily able to defeat the radicals, but ran into a
problem against the follow up attack by the Space Pirates known as the Red
Wings. Led by a guy named Hiro, the Red Wings were devestating against the
Imperial Remnants, and even managed to get Patrocinor Imprisoned for Most of
the skirmish.
~

1 PATROCINOR7 BIO7~
After the War was over, Patrocinor discovered disturbing news, it was Cinna who
had had him imprisoned. However, Patrocinor wasn't the type to hold a grudge
against loved ones, so he forgave Cinna, and moved on. He also met Rayleen
Koran at this time, who would eventually become the First of the Imperial
Remnants, and a Protector for those in it.
His beloved wife Carus, grew progressively more Ill, and left Patrocinor to
return home to Scarlettica to find a cure. Patrocinor responded by burying
himself further into his work. The Galaxy entered a time of unsteady peace.
Patrocinor spent the extra time he had trying to patch things up with his
family, and trying to put himself at inner peace.
The Hapan Consortium Crumbled, and was replaced by the Outer Territory
Alliance, after a few skirmishes with the Imperial Remnants, they soon
pacified themselves. The Red Wings however, oppurtunists as always, made a
giant Push against the Imperial Remnants, but soon themselves collapsed
completely. Patrocinor, along with Rayleen, re-organized the Imperial Remnants
again. 
The Imperial Remnants began to prosper, it gained masive support from all the
Planets, and enrolled record numbers of officers. Patrocinor also found
himself with another gift, a grand-daughter. His son Cinna had adopted a
Wonderful baby girl, Katrina's daughter, Kaitlin Slaven. Patrocinor had
managed to find happiness again. 
~

1 PATROCINOR8 BIO8~
A third major Clan had arised in the Galaxy, the Algaroth Continuum. However
the Imperial Remnants, and Patrocinor, prospered. 
That is, until one ordinary day, Patrocinor was in his personal transport, and
landed down on the Zoltri Space Pad. He was stabbed to death by an Unknown
Assailant, you had caught him un-armed and un-prepared. The galaxy mourned the
loss, and Patrocinor, after his visitation and funeral, was laid to rest on
Corellia. However, there are rumours, that on a still night, one can hear the
tormented roars of the dragon Echo through the Wind. But those are only
rumours...


  
So the story would seem to end. However, remaining in style with the rest of
the bio, this part of the bio will remain untouched. Even as the bio
continues, in synch with the life of Patrocinor, the parts that are already
written will stay unchanged, as a testament to how one's aspects and thoughts
can change. For example, there is an obvious difference between Patro's
thoughts and actions in Bio 1-3, and 4-8. And there will most likely be a
difference in 9+. All I can hope, is that you enjoy reading this, and that it
inspires you to inspire roleplaying here.
  
Sincerely, 
The Man Behind Patrocinor Dawnbreaker

  petname short a fierce, mottled mutt!

The "desc" command works just like it does for setting your own 
description.  Use the same command syntax for this option. See "help 
description" for more information on the "petname desc" option. 
  
A word about &Bc&Ro&Yl&Mo&Wr&w.

However, colors work fine for any of the descriptions.

-1 QUARREN~
Quarren is a species named for the aliens who are commonly called Squid Heads
by the galaxies general populace. These amphibious beings share the world of
Calamari with the Mon Calamari race, though the Quarren prefer the depths of
the floating cities to the upper reaches the Mon Cals call home. The Quarren
are more practical and conservative than their idealistic world-mates. Whereas
the Mon Calamari have adopted the Basic as their language of choice, the
Quarren have kept their oceanic tounge. The Quarren are sea dwellers, able to
live out of the water, but preferring the security of the ocean depths, These
pragmatic people are unwilling to trust new ideas. They do not dream of
brighter tomorrows like the Mon Cals, but instead hold fast to the reality of
yesterdays. While they profess that the two races should remain in the sea,
they have followed the Mon Cals into their floating cities and out among the
stars. They have become dependant on the Calamarians, and this dependancy has
led to resentment and outright hatred. Rumors persist that it was a small
number of Quarren who helped the Empire originally invade the planet. In the
face of invading forces, Quarren cooperated with the Mon Calamari to repel the
Imperials. But since that day, many Quarren have fled the planet to seek a life
elsewhere in the galaxy. They seem to have purposely remained apart from both
the Alliance and The Empire, preferring to find a place on the fringes of
society. Quarren can often be found working with pirates, slavers, crime lords,
smugglers, and other unsavory sorts.

101 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>

These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.

Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.

Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099

This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.

Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.

See CHECKVNUMS, ZONES, NEWZONES, VNUMS

old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically

as this are limited to once every 6 hours, so if one Savior does one,
another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.

A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.

Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.

See RESTORETIME

restricted to.

See CEDIT

-1 RODIAN RODIANS RODIA~
Rodians are among the Galaxy's best bounty hunters.  The history of Rodia
is peppered with wars and fueds, many of which are long and bloody.
Trained to fight from birth, they are amazingly agile and intelligent.
Though they almost never go into the scientific fields, their hand-to-hand
combat tactics are some of the best in the Galaxy.

For a long time before external contact was made, the Rodian people fought
and killed their own people.  When outside contact was established, they
quickly spread far and wide, seeking work as mercenaries, combat teachers,
assassins, body guards, and especially bounty hunters.  Rodain culture is
divided into different families.  Even now, families sometimes wage long
wars against each other, rather than moving against the outside war.

101 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

T###         check for item of type ###
V#####       check for item of vnum #####
Kword        check for item with keyword 'word'
G#####       check if player has ##### amount of gold
H####        check if player has #### amount of hitpoints

Special operators:
+ don't consume this component
@ decrease component's value[0], and extract if it reaches 0
# decrease component's value[1], and extract if it reaches 0
$ decrease component's value[2], and extract if it reaches 0
% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
^^ decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0
&& decrease component's value[5], and extract if it reaches 0
and ! will make the power fail if the caster is carrying that component.

Example: V1100 V+1101
The power will only succeed if the caster is carrying objects of vnums
1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the power,
and the object of vnum 1101 will not.

With the decremental operators (@#$%^^&&), the object must have at least
a value of 1 in the respective location for the power to succeed.

0 TAG~
. Sometimes life in the world can get a bit stressfull, so we all need
to relax and play games from time to time.  One way you can do this is
by starting up a game of tag ammongst your fellow players.  The rules
are simple!

  To start a game of tag, you must first Tag someone (Using TAG Player)
If no one is nearby or willing to be 'IT' first, you can tag yourself.
The idea is then for players to run arround the world trying to avoid
being caught by the person who is 'IT', Only one person can be 'IT' at
any one time, and when they catch someone their 'IT' status is removed
and the player they tag becomes 'IT'.

  Whenever the state of play changes, eg if someone tags someone else,
starts a game, or ends a game players are informed via an echo.


  Commands are as follows...

  TAG Player- Start a game, or tag the next person if you are already IT
  TAG show- Shows wether a game is in progress, and if so displays who
  is currently IT
  TAG quit- Used to end a game of tag, can only be issued by the
  player who is IT

  Tag Version 1.1 was written by Voltec (Voltec@cyberdude.com) for EotN.
--NOTAG toggles the option if you are able to be tagged or not.
&RTag was updated for SWR/Unknow Regions by Gavin&B(ur_gavin@hotmail.com)

Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/force/move regeneration, power
duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/force/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.

Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

arms, which end in wide, splayed fingers. Their heads are blunt, with beady red
eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth. Their scales range in color from orange

vicious, warlike race, the Trandoshans evolved into hunters, and were

-1 TWI'LEK TWI'LEKS TWILEK~
Twi'lek is ther species name of the humanoid aliens with twin head tentacles.
They come from the planet Ryloth, located in a system in the Outer Rim. The
Twi'lek language combines verbal components with subtle head-tail movements.
With the meanings provided by the head-tail movements, Twi'leks can carry on
private conversations in the midst of other species. Twi'leks live in vast city
complexes located on the planets dark side. Each complex is autonomous,
goverened by a head clan of five Twi'leks who jointly oversee production,
trade, and other daily endeavours. As the technology level of Ryloth does not
support spacefaring capabilities, the Twi'leks must depend on neighboring
systems (such as Tatooine), pirates, smugglers, and merchants for their contact
with the rest of the galaxy. They attract these ships with their chief export,
ryll. The mineral ryll has legitimate medicinal uses, but it is also a popular
and dangerously addictive recreational substance used in the Corporate Sector.
One hazard the Twi'leks face on a regular basis is slavers, who come to their
world to fill their ships with Twi'lek slaves.

Unknown Level: Y'know these things pop up randomly :P
Syntax: The hell would I know...

This skill, is absolutely useless, it has no meaning and no purpose :)
~

1 USE~
.
Syntax : Use (item)

Quite obviously lets you use an item.
~

101 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]

The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke

When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

101 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

-1 VERPINE ROCHE "ROCHE ASTROID FIELD"~
Verpine are an advanced species of bipedal insectoids. Their thin, sticklike
bodies have awkwardly articulated joints and chitinous shells. Two antennae jut
from the sides of their heads, which have two large eyes and short snouts. The
Verpine live in the Roche asteroid field, using great repulsor shells to keep
occupied asteroids from crashing into each other and to deflect other bits of
space debris. They are innate experts in most fields of technology, and their
childlike fascinations with all types of machinery has served them well. They
hollow out the asteroids for use as colonies, sealing them against space and
filling them with all kinds of technological wonders. The Verpine have
developed into expert starship builders. The Slayn & Korpil Corporation, named
for two neighboring Verpine colonies, has been well known and respected since
the days of the Old Republic. It was the Verpine who helped admiral ackbar
design and build the B-Wing starfighters.

105 WATCH~
. &w 
&W Syntax: &G watch                  &W Shows you a help screen 
&W Syntax: &G watch size             &W Shows the size of your watch file 
&W Syntax: &G watch clear            &W Deletes your watch file 
&W Syntax: &G watch show             &W Shows all your active watches 
&W Syntax: &G watch player <name>    &W Starts watching a player 
&W Syntax: &G watch site <site>      &W Starts watching all players from site
&W Syntax: &G watch delete <number>  &W Stops a watch 
&W Syntax: &G watch print 1          &W Shows file starting at line 1 
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500        &W Shows file starting at line 500 
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500
  
Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site. 
  
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you 
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You 
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file. 
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily 
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you 
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space. 
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command 
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file. 
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file. 
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

-1 WOOKIEE WOOKIEES~
With a large bonus to strength and constition, the small wisdon penalty is
easily offset.  They are well suited to be soldiers, though their code of

Once befriended, a Wookiee will stay loyal for his or her entire life, which
can be as long as three hundred years.
Wookiees are among the galaxy's greatest warriors.  They are not, however,
mearly large stupid beasts.  While the inability to speak basic often portrays
them as huge, unthinking beasts, many are accomplished mechanics, engineers,
and scientists.
